# CAPTCHA


The start of Masters Machine Learning Final Project (RKMVERI). 

The main aim will be to provide a survey of current captcha breaking technologies (obviously open sourced), and to publish a paper if possible at the end of the investigation. The extensive use of DNN and other image manipulation technologies will be the main aim of this project. We will extensively use kernels available from Kaggle, which will help us to provide a backbone for our research. We will train in collaboratory as much as possible so we are keeping the data here itself.
