# CAPTCHA

We have build many models to solve some of the difficult open sourced CAPTCHAs that are available on the internet. We have obtained about more than 99.5% accuracy on most of the models, which converges at about 5 epochs. The ``generators`` folder have some of the modified codes that we have used to generate the data to feed into the model. The ``pyfiles`` folder section have all of the models and their corresponding python codes.
